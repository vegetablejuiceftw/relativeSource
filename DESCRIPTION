Description: When importing files from 3 folders deep, that depend on files in the said folder, writing source relative to the WS is a pain. Same applies if you try to run R files outside of your WS. This package auto generates the full path to the directory of the file the relative_source is called, and thus abstracts away the need to do it yourself.
Depends: R (>= 3.4.4)
